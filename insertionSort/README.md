# Insertion Sort #

Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works the way we sort playing cards in our hands.

It works by iterating through the array, and inserting the value to the right spot.

Insertion sort has a worst case time complexity of `O(n^2)`, a best case time complexity of `O(n)`, and an average performance of `O(n^2)`. It also has a worst case auxillary memory complexity of `O(1)`
