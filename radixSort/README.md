# Radix sort #

Radix sort comes in two variations, LSD (least significant digit) and MSD (most significant digit)

Radix sort works by using counting sort to sort an array by digits, eliminating the problem with counting sort whereby a large range of numbers will take a lot of memory. 

## LSD ##

In least significant digit radix sort, the least significant digit is sorted first, then the next digit, and so on

i.e in the number 1234, 4 would be considered first, then 3, then 2, then 1

## MSD

in most significant digit radix sort, the most significant digit is sorted first, then the next digit, and so on

i.e in the number 1234, 1 would be considered first, then 2, then 3, then 4
