# Selection sort #

Selection sort works by taking the smallest in an array and placing it in the correct position. This implementation is in-place, and does not maintain a second array.

Selection sort has a worst, best, and average case time complexity of `O(n^2)`, and a worst case memory complexity of `O(1)`
